#     - page: "I.18"
#       content: All warfare is based on deception.
#     - page: "III.18"
#       content: "Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know
#         yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If
#         you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained
#         you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor
#         yourself, you will succumb in every battle."
#     - page: "V.15"
#       content: Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;
#         decision, to the releasing of a trigger.
#     - page: "IX.24"
#       content: Humble words and increased preparations are signs that
#         the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving
#         forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.
#     - page: "VI.1"
#       content: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of
#         the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the
#         field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.
#     - page: "X.31"
#       content: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory
#         will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you
#         may make your victory complete.
